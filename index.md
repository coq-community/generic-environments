## About

Welcome to the Generic Environments project website! This project is part of [coq-community](https://github.com/coq-community/manifesto).

Generic Environments is a library which provides an abstract data type of environments, as a functor parameterized by a module defining variables, and a function which builds environments for such variables with any Type of type. Usual operations over environments are defined, along with an extensive set of basic and more advanced properties. Moreover, an implementation using lists satisfying and all the required properties is provided.


This is an open source project, licensed under the MIT license.
