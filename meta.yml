synopsis: Generic Environments is a library that provides an abstract data type for environments
description: >
  Generic Environments is a library which provides an abstract data
  type of environments, as a functor parameterized by a module
  defining variables, and a function which builds environments for
  such variables with any Type of type. Usual operations over
  environments are defined, along with an extensive set of basic and
  more advanced properties. Moreover, an implementation using lists
  satisfying and all the required properties is provided.
